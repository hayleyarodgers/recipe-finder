Group "project01-01" - Recipe Findr

# description

Our task was to work with a group to build an application that searches and displays results from the Library of Congress API.

# what

Our group decided to do a "Recipe finder" that allowed the user to type in 3 ingreadientes to return a result of potential meals that can be cooked featuring those ingredients.

# how

To achieve this our group used an API from Spoonacular, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

During this project, we also used Bootstrap and Moment.js()
